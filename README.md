# ansible-arch

Besides [Gentoo](https://www.gentoo.org/), [Arch](https://archlinux.org/) is my most favourite linux distribution. I'll use those ansible playbooks to speed up the creation of my own environment, so i'll be up & running in a few minutes on every system - virtual or on hardware.

## environment

`environment.yml`
